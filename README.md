## 1.Introduction
üìò  
### 1.1 Purpose 
üí°  
This document describes the functional and non-functional requirements for a decentralized application ([DApp](#acronyms-and-abbreviations)) focused on digital assets raffles, based on a commit and reveal scheme ([CRS](#acronyms-and-abbreviations)) as source of randomness for electing the winner.  
The application described in this document will be further refered as [RAFFLEIZE C-A-R-D-A-N-A](#acronyms-and-abbreviations).  
This document covers only the application structure and behaviour and does not cover the consesnsus mechanism and communication protocol of the underlying blockchain.

### 1.2 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
üë•  
This document serves as a comprehensive guide detailing the functionalities, scenarios, and acceptance criteria of the application. Intended for developers (to understand and implement the specified functionalities), testers (to create test cases and ensure the application meets the stipulated requirements), and other stakeholders. It provides a clear blueprint of how the application should function and behave under various circumstances.

### 1.3 Scope
üåê  
Designed to capitalize on the digital assets trend, [RAFFLEIZE C-A-R-D-A-N-A](#acronyms-and-abbreviations) is tailored for facilitating creation, management of, and participation in online raffles. 
This application allows users to raffle their digital assets, providing a chance for other users (participants) to win these assets in exchange for purchasing a ticket. By leveraging the commit and reveal scheme it decentralizes trust, ensuring transparency and fairness in the winner selection process.  

#### Objectives and Benefits
üéØ  
- **Decentralized Trust**: The primary objective of [RAFFLEIZE C-A-R-D-A-N-A](#acronyms-and-abbreviations) is to eliminate the reliance on a central authority for trust. The commit and reveal scheme ensures that the process of picking a winner is transparent and verifiable, thus fostering trust among participants.

- **Digital Asset Monetization**: Users with digital assets can create raffles, offering others the chance to win these assets. This provides a unique avenue for asset owners to monetize their holdings.

- **Broadened Participation**: By allowing participants to buy tickets and potentially win digital assets, the platform democratizes access to these assets, which might be expensive or rare otherwise.

- **Enhanced Engagement**: The thrill of participating in a raffle and the potential to win valuable assets drive user engagement, encouraging more users to join the ecosystem. 

#### Differentiators 
üí•üí•üí•
- **Enhanced Liquidity**: Tokenizing raffle ownership and tickets makes these assets more liquid. Owners can easily trade or sell their stakes or participation rights on various platforms, not limited to the original DApp. This increases the assets' marketability and potential value.
 
- **Recursive Raffle Opportunities**: (Raffles of Raffles) Owners can create raffles for their raffle stakes or tickets, adding a recursive layer of engagement. This not only multiplies the opportunities for users to engage with the platform but also introduces a novel concept of raffle chains, where one can win a stake in another raffle, thereby increasing the excitement and engagement levels.

- **Privacy Preservation**: Anonymity ensures that participants' and owners' identities are kept private, fostering a secure environment where users feel comfortable engaging in transactions. This privacy is particularly appealing to users who prioritize discretion in their online activities and financial dealings.

- **Inclusive Participation**: By removing the need for identity verification for participation, the platform can attract a wider audience, including those who, for various reasons, prefer or need to remain anonymous. This inclusivity strengthens the platform's market position by broadening its user base.

#### Goals and Business Alignment
[RAFFLEIZE C-A-R-D-A-N-A](#acronyms-and-abbreviations) aligns with the broader trend of decentralization and blockchain adoption.

## 2. Description
### 2.1 Perspective

[RAFFLEIZE C-A-R-D-A-N-A](#acronyms-and-abbreviations) is designed to fill a niche in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. However, its foundation and philosophy are deeply rooted in the broader shift towards decentralization and blockchain technology.

#### Context and Origin

While raffles have been a popular method of asset distribution and engagement for centuries, the digital age and rise of cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens ([NFTs](#acronyms-and-abbreviations)) have reshaped the potential of such events. [RAFFLEIZE C-A-R-D-A-N-A](#acronyms-and-abbreviations) is not merely a digital transformation of traditional raffles but a novel system that integrates the principles of decentralization.

#### Relation to Larger Systems

-  **Cardano Blockchain** : the current DApp, primarily relies on Cardano blockchain technology for it's core functionalities. The underlying blockchain provides the backbone of trust and decentralization and the underlying infrastructure that makes digital assets possible. 
- **IPFS**: Blockchain typically stores metadata that includes information about the digital asset, like an image, video, or piece of music. However, storing large files directly on the blockchain is impractical due to size limitations and high costs. [IPFS](#acronyms-and-abbreviations) offers a solution for decentralized storage. Instead of storing the actual data on blockchain, digital assets metadata often includes a URL or hash pointing to a file on [IPFS](#acronyms-and-abbreviations), utilizing its content addressing system to ensure the integrity and permanence of the data. 

#### System Overview and Interfaces

The diagram below highlights the key logical components of the DApp and their interactions. Each component plays a specific role in the functionality of the DApp, particularly within the context of a blockchain network. 

![Component Diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mariusgeorgescu/raffleize/main/Documentation/Diagrams/Component/ComponentDiagram-RaffleDApp-HighLevel.puml)

The user directly interacts with the UI, which is the entry point of the DApp. The UI facilitates user interaction with the blockchain through the Wallet component, which securely authorizes transactions. The DApp service provider acts as a bridge, handling complex interactions with the blockchain and ensuring smooth operation of the application. The blockchain network itself is the backbone, providing a decentralized and secure platform for executing the raffle's smart contracts.

Here's an elaborated description of each component:

##### User Interface Component

- **Role**: This component is the front-end o3f the DApp, where users interact with the application. It presents the user interface through which users can participate in raffles or organize their own.
- **Functions**: It manages user inputs, displays information (like raffle details and results), and initiates actions (like entering the raffle).
- **Interaction**: The UI communicates with the Browser Wallet to create transactions that will be sent to the blockchain.

##### Wallet Component
- **Role**: This is a third-party browser wallet that interacts with the DApp. It handles cryptographic functions related to the user's blockchain identity.
- **Functions**: Its primary function is to sign transactions, which is crucial for actions that require user authorization, such as entering a raffle or claiming rewards.
- **Interaction**: Receives transaction data from the UI, signs it with the user's private key, and then communicates it back to the UI or directly to the blockchain network.


##### DApp Service Provider
- **Role**: This backend component acts as the intermediary between the UI and the blockchain network.
- **Functions**:
  - Querying the Blockchain: It retrieves data from the blockchain, such as the status of the raffle, entries, and winners.
  - Constructing Transactions: It prepares transactions based on user actions that are to be executed on the blockchain.
- **Interaction**: It communicates with the blockchain network to fetch data or submit signed transactions.

##### Blockchain Network 
- **Role**: The underlying decentralized infrastructure that executes and records all operations related to the raffle.
- **Functions**: Hosts the smart contracts which govern the raffle logic, ensuring trustless and transparent execution. It processes transactions, updates the state of the raffle, and ensures the integrity and security of the entire process.
- **Interaction**: Interacts with the DApp service provider, receiving queries and transactions, and returning the results or confirmation of actions taken.


#### High Level Architecture:

There are three architectural versions envisaged for the DApp, each representing a different approach, varying by where the DApp static content is hosted, where transactions are constructed and how transactions are submited to the blockchain.


##### Version 1: Centralized Hosting and Backend Transaction Handling
- **Static Content Hosting**: The DApp's static content, like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, is hosted on a centralized web server.
- **Transaction Construction and Submission**: Transactions are constructed and submitted through the DApp's backend. The process involves:
  1. Users interacting with the UI, which calls an endpoint in the OffChain component.
  2. The OffChain component queries the Cardano node and constructs the transaction.
  3. The constructed transaction is sent to the user's browser wallet for signing.
  4. Once signed, the transaction is sent back to the OffChain component, which submits it to the Cardano node for final processing on the blockchain.


![Component Diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mariusgeorgescu/raffleize/main/Documentation/Diagrams/Component/ComponentDiagram-RaffleDApp-version1.puml) 

---
##### Version 2: Centralized Hosting with Partial Decentralized Transaction Handling
- **Static Content Hosting**: Similar to Version 1, the static content is hosted on a centralized server.
- **Transaction Construction**: The construction of transactions still happens in the DApp's backend.
- **Transaction Submission**: The signed transactions are submitted through the user's browser wallet or a custom node configured in the wallet. This adds a layer of decentralization to the process. *(Some wallets allow configuring a custom endpoint for submitting transactions, offering more flexibility and control to the user.)*

![Component Diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mariusgeorgescu/raffleize/main/Documentation/Diagrams/Component/ComponentDiagram-RaffleDApp-version2.puml)

---

##### Version 3: Decentralized Hosting and Transaction Handling
- **Static Content Hosting**: The DApp's static content is hosted on the IPFS network, offering a decentralized hosting solution.
- **Transaction Construction and Submission**:
    1.  The UI queries data from a Blockchain Services Provider.
    2. Transactions are constructed directly in the user's browser and sent to the browser wallet for signing.
    3. The signed transactions are then submitted to the blockchain network through the wallet's backend or a custom node, emphasizing decentralized processing.

![Component Diagram](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mariusgeorgescu/raffleize/main/Documentation/Diagrams/Component/ComponentDiagram-RaffleDApp-version3.puml)

--- 


Each version offers different levels of decentralization and control:

- **Version 1** focuses on a more traditional web application structure with centralized control over transaction processing and content hosting.
- **Version 2** introduces an element of decentralization in transaction submission while keeping the content hosting and transaction construction centralized.
- **Version 3** fully embraces decentralization by leveraging IPFS for hosting and allowing transactions to be constructed and submitted directly from the user's browser, reducing reliance on a centralized backend.
